### Supremacy_vs_Goal_Distribution

This project seeks to observe how goals are divided between the favourite and underdog in a soccer match and how this ratio changes with the pre-match expected supremacy difference between the teams. 

A dataset of approximately 145k European domestic matches from football-data.co.uk was used and pre-processed to obtain all relevant expected match and over/under percentages. Matches were grouped according to supremacy level before linear and polynomial regression analysis was carried out to identify the best fit for the grouped data.
